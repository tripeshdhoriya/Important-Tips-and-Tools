User=root
Group=root
ExecStart=/usr/local/cassandra/bin/cassandra -f
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=20
SuccessExitStatus=143

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


Replace <your-username> and <your-group> with your Linux username and group as acconding yu need.

8. WSL does not fully support systemd, which means you can't use systemctl commands to manage services. However, you can still manually start services or create scripts to start services automatically when WSL starts.

Create a Start Script:

Open a text editor and create a script file, for example, start_cassandra.sh:

	Command - nano start_cassandra.sh
	
9. Add the following content to the script:

	#!/bin/bash
    /usr/local/cassandra/bin/cassandra
	
   Save the file and exit the text editor.

10. Make the Script Executable:

	Make the script executable by running:

    Command : chmod +x start_cassandra.sh

11. Run the Script:
    You can now run the script to start Cassandra:
	
	./start_cassandra.sh
	
	This will start Cassandra in the foreground. You can keep the terminal open while using Cassandra.
	
12. utomatically Start Cassandra on WSL Startup (Optional):

	If you want Cassandra to start automatically when you open your WSL terminal, you can add the script to your .bashrc file.
	
	Open your .bashrc file in a text editor:

     nano ~/.bashrc
	 
	Scroll to the end of the file.
	Add the following line to execute the start_cassandra.sh script:
	
	/home/start_cassandra.sh &
	
	Save the changes and exit the text editor.
	
	
you can Access cqlsh - /usr/local/cassandra/bin/cqlsh

you can Access nodetool - /usr/local/cassandra/bin/nodetool status

Note: If you are working on the WSL machine and need to access it from outside the WSL system, you must set up Java 11 and Cassandra in the environment variable PATH. Otherwise, you won't be able to access cqlsh and nodetool status from the Windows machine."
